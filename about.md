**Hi, I’m Aidan — a quality specialist by trade, a problem-solver by nature, and a curious creator at heart.**

For the past 20 years, I've been immersed in software development and quality assurance, driven by the challenge of breaking down complex systems, improving them, and seeing the real impact that great software can have on people’s lives. This passion led me to co-found Freely Homeschool Planner, where I turned a vision for a flexible education management tool into a platform that supports homeschooling families around the world.

Like many, I’ve become fascinated by the evolution of AI - especially its potential to assist and augment our abilities at a personal level. I’m focused on finding tools and workflows that help us stay in our creative space - solving problems conceptually, while letting AI handle the heavy lifting of implementation.

**Cloning the Goose** is my tongue-in-cheek metaphor for this: scaling our ability to produce golden eggs without burning out in the process. If I can help you lay a few extra golden eggs, I’ll consider that a job well done.
