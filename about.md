**Hi, I’m Aidan — a quality specialist by trade, a problem-solver by nature, and a curious creator at heart.**

For the past 20 years, I've been immersed in software development and quality assurance, driven by the challenge of breaking down complex systems, improving them, and seeing the real impact that great software can have on people’s lives. This passion led me to co-found [Freely Homeschool Planner](https://www.learnfreely.app/), where I turned a vision for a flexible education management tool into a platform that supports homeschooling families around the world.

Recently I’ve become fascinated by the evolution of AI - especially its potential to assist and augment our abilities at a personal level. I’m focused on finding tools and workflows that help me stay in my creative space - solving problems conceptually, while letting AI handle the heavy lifting.

**Cloning the Goose** is my tongue-in-cheek metaphor for scaling personal productivity. In [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People), Stephen R. Covey references Aesop's fable [The Goose and the Golden Egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goose_that_Laid_the_Golden_Eggs) to make a point about the need to balance the results we seek (production) with the capacity to produce those results (production capability). 

So we need to nurture the goose (i.e. look after ourselves)—but what if we could also clone it, using AI to scale our best thinking, decision-making, and creative output... without burning ourselves out.
