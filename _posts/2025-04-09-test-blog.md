I'll get straight to the point - **AI has been an absolute game-changer for me.**

Yes, there's a lot of hype. But it has genuinely helped me do things that would’ve been difficult (or even impossible) on my own.

There’s so much I want to share about what I’ve learned, but I figured the best place to start is with *how I talk to AI*. Or more precisely: how I **think about** talking to AI *before* I even open the chat window.

I think one of the craziest things about this tech is how wildly the results can vary. Two people can ask it for the same thing - one gets gold, the other gets garbage. We've never dealt with anything quite like it before.

But through a lot of experimenting (and a fair bit of trial and error), I’ve landed on a simple process that has allowed me to get some incredible results. Here’s how I approach it.

## How I actually talk to AI

There’s an ever-growing pool of advice out there about prompting—and I’m always learning from it. Frameworks like [RACE](https://www.acronymat.com/2024/12/22/) are well worth exploring.

But I’ve found that trying to craft the perfect prompt can become a barrier of its own. What’s worked better for me is starting with a few simple questions that help me frame the interaction before I even begin typing.

### What role do I need it to play?

I don’t mean a detailed persona (though that can come later). I’m talking about the type of interaction I need right now. Am I looking for:

- A task helper – to answer a question, review code, or tidy up some text
- A thought partner – to explore ideas I haven’t fully formed yet
- An expert – to advise me in an area I don’t know much about

Just having a mental label for the role I need sets the tone and helps me frame my opening message.

### What context does it need?

Sometimes, it really does feel like AI just "gets" me. And with memory features improving, this ability will only become more powerful. But I’ve learned not to rely on that—because even when an AI has years of memory about your style, your projects, or your preferences, it still doesn’t automatically know what matters in this moment.

I always try to ask:

> What does it need to know to be helpful right now?

If I’m asking for expert advice, context is essential—who the audience is, what the goal is, what I’ve already tried.
For simpler tasks or thought partnering, a brief setup might be enough. Either way, I’ve found that:

When the response feels off, it’s usually because the model doesn’t have the full picture.

Large language models rarely ask clarifying questions (by default), so they often make incorrect assumptions.

The good news is I don’t have to get it all perfect up front. I can layer in context as I go—but it helps to stay aware of what might be missing.

### What kind of conversation do I want to have?

This one’s trickier to pin down, because it’s more about feel than mechanics.

Before I start typing, I try to imagine the kind of conversation I want to have:
- Do I want empathy or challenge?
- Am I looking for fast answers or careful thinking?
- Should it push back, or just help me clarify?

This helps me adjust the tone of the conversation—or course-correct if it drifts.
If it’s being too agreeable, I’ll ask it to be more critical.
If it’s giving me information I can’t make sense of, I’ll clarify what kind of outcome I’m looking for.

I’ve also found that **pacing** the conversation makes a big difference—especially when I’m working through something complex. Instead of diving straight into “give me the solution,” I’ll ask exploratory questions first. This helps flesh out the context together, and often leads to a better outcome than jumping to an answer too soon.
