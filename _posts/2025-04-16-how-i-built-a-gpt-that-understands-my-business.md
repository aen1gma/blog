I'm completely clueless when it comes to sales and marketing. If someone tested my sales skills, here's how it would go...

> Me: Do you want to buy this pen?
>
> Them: No
>
> Me: Ok, fine

So when I say that AI has been a game-changer for me, it's the marketing use case that first blew my mind. 

## Marketing without marketing skills

Freely needed an email lead nurture sequence. Between my wife and I, we knew the key points we wanted to convey and how we wanted customers to feel when they read the emails. But bringing this to life as a sequence of emails, each with a catchy title, value proposition and call to action... wow, what a challenge. Without the custom GPT that I built specifically to help us with this challenge, it would have taken months to personally upskill enough to produce the result that we managed to achieve. Realistically, though, it just wouldn't have happened. And, the best part, we can now take the result, and all of our learning, and feed it back into the GPT so that it give us an even better result quicker next time.

## Creating a Custom GPT

I use Chat GPT, which has the concept of a [Custom GPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554397-creating-a-gpt). But, if you're using a different platform, it might be called something different like [Projects](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9517075-what-are-projects), if you're using Claude. The first challenge was giving it enough context to deeply understand my business. I didn't want generic advice, I wanted the AI to understand who we are, our values, what we're trying to achieve, and what's important to our customers. 

### Creating the knowledge files

I took a concept I learned about on [AI Explored Podcast](https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/ai-explored-podcast/) and tailored it a bit to my needs. With the help of Chat GPT itself, I created the following files...

- The Business - Use this file to get a high-level understanding of the company’s purpose, mission, vision, target market, products, and strategic goals. This file establishes the why behind Freely and articulates what makes the Freely Homeschool Planner unique in the market. It also outlines the pricing model, product roadmap, and long-term vision for the business, which is essential for aligning marketing efforts with growth goals.
- Customer Avatars - Use this file to get detailed, emotional, and behavioral insights into core customer types like “The Tech-Savvy Planner” and “The Overwhelmed and Disorganized.” This document helps you build emotionally resonant messaging, personalized content strategies, and psychologically aligned campaigns that speak directly to their fears, desires, habits, and triggers.
- Marketing Plan - Use this file to align content, messaging, and campaigns with your target market’s demographic, psychographic, and behavioral data. This file includes top pain points, desires, emotional drivers, and key messaging pillars for Freely. It’s essential for creating consistent, brand-aligned marketing that increases engagement, trust, and conversions.
- Content Guidelines - Use this file to craft emotionally resonant and strategically structured content across all platforms (blog, email, social media). This document provides a framework for storytelling (problem → hope → action → connection → inspiration → CTA) and ensures that every piece supports Freely’s voice: empowering, heartfelt, supportive, and practical.
- Product Features - Use this file to understand the capabilities and benefits of Freely Homeschool Planner in detail. This file supports creating feature-benefit content, onboarding materials, tutorials, and comparison posts that help customers see how Freely solves real-world homeschooling problems. Great for product launch campaigns, demo videos, and sales enablement.
- Content Examples - Use this file to see real examples of high-performing blog content. These examples model storytelling, community voice, emotional connection, and product integration done well. You can extract tone, format, and themes that resonate with Freely’s audience and use them to shape future posts, scripts, and campaigns.
